# IPL-LSTM
The dataset used for this model is taken from kaggle with two .csv files, 1.Matches.csv and 2.Deliveries.csv.
The LSTM model predicts which one of two teams has higher chance of winning the match based on the ball by ball data.

This is first attempt to explore the LSTM Model, so if something is wrong with coding and want to share, so you can connect with me on linkedIn profile www.linkedin.com/in/akshay-chindarkar
